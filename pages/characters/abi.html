            <ul>
                <li>His jHK is one of the best in the game and very difficult to anti-air</li>
                <li>From mid-range they will often keep jumping with jHK to approach</li>
                <li>You want to stand right at the range of his crLP, then you’ll be able to anti-air</li>
                <li>Dogura vs Itazan from the RAGE league is an example of how to play this</li>
                <li>Dashing forward is effective. Even if you eat stHP, it won’t be a crush counter so it’s not that painful</li>
                <li>The aim will be to V-Reversal just 1 time on guaranteed V-Reversalable string so instead, go for a throw</li>
                <li>His still is 1000, which doesn’t match his 1075 health</li>
                <li>His command grab range got nerfed</li>
                <li>Overall, still a relatively strong character</li>
                <li><b>If he’s running towards you, IT’S BETTER TO JUMP FORWARD</b></li>
            </ul>
