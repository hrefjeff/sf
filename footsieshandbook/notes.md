Notes on the Sonic Hurrican Footsies Handbook

The goal of this is to bring awareness to each aspect of footsies.
I don't plan on using _everything_ I learn here on a constant basis, but it is important to know and learn how to describe situations.

# Forward (Defining footsies and zoning)

The foreword provides a general overview and points towards the appendix where both Footsies and Zoning is defined.
It's cool because it describes how to best learn footsies, or an aspect of it:

  1. Don't jump the entire match
  2. Don't dash the entire match
  3. Limit yourself to one psychic DP attempt per match

Every round you play with these rules will help you gain a better understanding of your normal moves,
will teach you how to control space by walking,
and will force you to learn the meaning of patient offense.

Zoning means acquiring and maintaining certain positions on the screen favorable to your character's arsenal while at the same time disadvantageous/restrictive to your opponent.
The first step in understanding matchups is determining where your character has the biggest advantages and finding ways to establish that distance starting from every commmon scenario.

  1. How do you get there at the beginning of the round?
  2. How do you get there after landing a combo?
  3. How do you get there after being thrown?
  4. How do you get there after blocking a jumping attack?


All these questions are relative because they change depending on which character you're fighting, ALONG WITH THEIR RESOURCES!

# Chapter 1 - Playing with max ranges

## (Element 1)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgVUUHU84YU&ab_channel=Crayfis]

Momentarily step into your opponent's poke range and quickly back out instead of attacking.
This bait works well in tense matches, after extended zoning periods of cautious zoning, or charge characters who rarely walk forward.

## (Element 2)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV6ckXL7AW8#t=1h45m29s]

Determine which combo/attack strings position your opponents barely outside of reversal range, especially when facing characters with great mobility.

## (Element 3)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNSK5IuSw3M&ab_channel=jchensor]

Once you've established a pattern of poking consistently at a certain range,
use your opponent's hesitation to walk up and throw them.
It's always dangerous to wander into enemy attack space,
so wait until you're certain you've trained them to think twice about pushing buttons.
