Notes on the Sonic Hurrican Footsies Handbook

The goal of this is to bring awareness to each aspect of footsies.
I don't plan on using _everything_ I learn here on a constant basis, but it is important to know and learn how to describe situations.

# Forward (Defining footsies and zoning)

The foreword provides a general overview and points towards the appendix where both Footsies and Zoning is defined.
It's cool because it describes how to best learn footsies, or an aspect of it:

  1. Don't jump the entire match
  2. Don't dash the entire match
  3. Limit yourself to one psychic DP attempt per match

Every round you play with these rules will help you gain a better understanding of your normal moves,
will teach you how to control space by walking,
and will force you to learn the meaning of patient offense.

Zoning means acquiring and maintaining certain positions on the screen favorable to your character's arsenal while at the same time disadvantageous/restrictive to your opponent.
The first step in understanding matchups is determining where your character has the biggest advantages and finding ways to establish that distance starting from every commmon scenario.

  1. How do you get there at the beginning of the round?
  2. How do you get there after landing a combo?
  3. How do you get there after being thrown?
  4. How do you get there after blocking a jumping attack?


All these questions are relative because they change depending on which character you're fighting, ALONG WITH THEIR RESOURCES!

# Chapter 1 - Playing with max ranges

## [Element 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgVUUHU84YU&ab_channel=Crayfis)

Momentarily step into your opponent's poke range and quickly back out instead of attacking.
This bait works well in tense matches, after extended zoning periods of cautious zoning, or charge characters who rarely walk forward.

## [Element 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV6ckXL7AW8#t=1h45m29s)

Determine which combo/attack strings position your opponents barely outside of reversal range, especially when facing characters with great mobility.

## [Element 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNSK5IuSw3M&ab_channel=jchensor)

Once you've established a pattern of poking consistently at a certain range,
use your opponent's hesitation to walk up and throw them.
It's always dangerous to wander into enemy attack space,
so wait until you're certain you've trained them to think twice about pushing buttons.

# Chapter 4 - Defensive Footsies/Baiting Meter

## [Element 10](https://youtu.be/Ns4D4129gA0?t=123)

If your opponent has full meter and you can tell they're eagerly fishing to land it,
stay far away for a while then walk into their c.MK range and immediately block low.
It's a relatively safe gamble and if they take the bait, you can punish them or at the very least you'll have neutralized the threat of their super meter.
If you're really advanced, you can take the hit with an airborne hop then pass right through the super.

## [Element 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYvGnYHZPbU#t=9m36s&ab_channel=Omnigamer)

While on the receiving end of lengthy combos and rush sequences, a lot of players attempt reversal supers at difficult link junctions and possible breaking points.
If you've caught your opponent gambling this way and you have a direct counter to their super move,
sometimes it's worthwhile to create an intentional gap during your attack string by inserting the appropriate counter.
If it works, the advantages are numerous.

## [Element 12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYvGnYHZPbU#t=9m36s&ab_channel=Omnigamer)

When an aggressive opponent willingly resets the match by pushing you away,
don't spring for the first opportunity to make a major move. It could be a trap.
Test the waters by whiffing a single low jab counter-bait or simply block patiently to see what your opponent has in mind.
Sometimes remaining calm through a tense moment is all it takes to avoid defeat.
