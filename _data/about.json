        "My name is Jeffrey. I live in Alabama, the southeast portion of the U.S.A. Outside of gaming I develop cloud-based web applications and love riding bicycles!",
        "I also enjoy playing Guilty Gear Strive, Smash bros, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, RPG's like Final Fantasy, and racing games. Baldur's Gate 3 is also amazing.",
        "You can find me playing mostly in the evening times. In the mornings I usually meditate or ride my bike to the coffee shop and read.",
        "Finally, dogs are the best. Every time you come home, they act like they haven't seen you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is they got different dogs for different people. Like pitbulls. The dog of dogs. If you're going to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pitbull."
