I play alotta Street Fighter 5 and I'm maining Ryu at the moment.

I play on PlayStation 4 (psn: jiggabeffrey, cfn: Boombahyay).

The plan is to transition to PC within the next couple of months (steam name: dookieBoots) and eventually make my salt public by streaming it on [twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/).
