title: Getting better at SF6

This post is an updated version of the <a href="https://hrefjeff.github.io/sf/2019/05/15/getting-better/" target="_blank">"getting better at Street Fighter 5 post"</a> I did a while back. I've banged my head against a wall trying to improve and I hope to save some else some bruises along the way in this process. Before we begin though, imagine a pilot flying a plane from L.A. in California to New York City and someone adjusts the flight path by 3.5 degrees south just before takeoff. The change is barely noticeable at takeoff, but the plane ends up landing in Washington, D.C. instead of New York City. That's 220 miles (or 350 kilometers to my imperial folk) from the destination. Now imagine this for improvement. If there is a misdirection when starting out doing something, you'll eventually have to correct it down the road. The point is: try to start any journey you make in the best way possible to set yourself up for success.

Without further ado, here is how we get better at SF6:

### <a name="head0"></a>Step 0. GO TO YOUR LOCAL FIGHTING GAME MEETUPS!

If you have the privilege to attend an offline local fighting game meet up... **GET OUT THERE AND ATTEND!** This is where you'll find yourself among friends who share your excitement for all things related to fighting games. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or just starting out, there is a place where fighting game enthusiasts meet up and is the perfect place to discuss strategies, share tips, and engage in digital battle. I attribute my small successes in fighting games to my local fight scene for teaching me about fighting games in general. Ultradavid on twitter (or X, whatever you want to call it) has kept up a spreadsheet of over 500 offline locations that host offline locals. You can find that <a href="https://x.com/ultradavid/status/1745282780937028005" target="_blank">here</a>.

### <a name="head1"></a>Step 1. Study your replays

I wholeheartedly agree with studying replay of yourself because of the great job Capcom has done with SFV's replay cabilities. I'll constantly go to CFN (capcom fighter's network) in the game and watch replays with both of the options "_key display_" and "_frame data_" turned on. Watching replays of your losses provided me a great basis for what I needed to work on. I recently learned Chris Tatarian (a SoCal Ken player) where he searches for one of his past replays that dates back to to a couple days or weeks prior to help him get an objective outlook on a replay. I was amazed by how many tendencies I found that I didn't know I had.
  
"But Jeffrey, what am I supposed to be looking for in my a replays!?" I'm glad you asked! I'll analyze my game by watching my replay in 2 phases. The first time I watch the replay, I'll watch it full speed and without interruption/pauses to get a wholistic view of what's going on in the match. Then I'll watch it a 2nd time and target any specific details I could work on. The details I find most important and helpful in getting better is by using 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJV-K0rLOC0" target="_blank">Frame Advantages' approach</a>. So I'll do what Tyrant and Packz recommend which is to answer these 3 questions when watching the replays:
  * How did I take damage?
  * How can I optimize my damage?
  * How did I get into the bad situation in the first place?

### <a name="head2"></a>2. Search for replays

I always make sure to find people who are more skilled than I am. When I started out with SF5 I would search for all the godlike players in the game and try to learn from them. What I ended up finding out myself is that I improved the most when I started viewing replays of someone who is a little bit or moderately more skilled relative to where I was. When I would watch replays of high level players (Grand masters and above when I was a rookie/bronze player), they would make decisions and movements that were completely out of context to me. I couldn't follow their rationale. However, when I started watching replays from a player that was slightly/moderately more skilled than I was I would be able to recognize the flow of situtations. It started becoming a conversation of "Oh snap, I see what he did there. That's smart." Or "Oh they dun goofed. Let's see what play they make to recover."
    
If I'm having trouble developing a strategy against a certain character or generally struggling with a match up, I get my ass on Youtube!! Search "Street fighter 5 <u>_**insert your character name here**_</u> vs <u>_**insert other character name here**_"</u>. There are plenty of players who are eager to upload their highlights of them bodying other characters that you can learn from. Also, CFN has this cool search feature in game where you can filter replays by character and league points. It's super helpful and wish I had known about it sooner.
    
### <a name="head3"></a>3. Find a favorite to learn from

Until we are winning premiere and major tournmanets there is always someone better than you and out-hussling you. Learn a lesson from them. I, myself, subscribe to a bunch of people and join their twitch streams/discord chats all the time. It's good practice to view the ways of the world and get an outside perspective. This gets into the social aspect of the game where I describe later.

### <a name="head4"></a>4. Muscle memory drills

Training mode. Training mode. Training mode. It's a very powerful tool to build MUSCLE POWER... err... I mean muscle memory. In my opinion you're never too good to go back to fundamentals. All the greatest individuals that practice their craft will practice day 1 stuff so it becomes second nature so they won't have to think about it when the situation arises. 

So before a ranked grind session or tournament, I'll do something called laps by opening up training mode and simply dashing across the stage 10 times. 5 times to the left and 5 times to the right. It gets me loose. Then I'll practice my bread-n-butter (b-n-b) combos. I'll do each combo 10 times in a row and if I drop a combo before I hit 10, I'll start the counter back at 1. Then I'll practice meaty setups. I'll do the same 10 reps in a row as the b-n-b combos. I'll also do some hit confirm training where I set the training dummy on "block random" and practice stopping my combo short if they block or continuing it if they do not block.

### <a name="head5"></a>5. Learn matchups in detail

I don't do this to the extent I should. It is definitely something I can work on. There are levels to everything but this is one where you can go deep down the rabit hole. I'd generally start with myself and my character. What attacks are plus on block? How does my hurtbox behave when throwing out a certain move? At what range does my character operate most effectively? Answering these questions will help you develop a sense of self-awareness on what you should and shouldn't do.
    
I'll go on down the list of opponenents I have faced and for each one try and figure out how my character can correctly respond with an opponents array of moves. The goal is to get to the point where you can automatically recognize what buttons you should rely on most and how you can use characters strengths to overcome the opponent. For instance, I recently learned more about the Karin Vs. Laura matchup. Laura has to play very risky because her buttons are not as good as Karin's in the neutral range. So in using that information that will set me up to look for dashes and overheads more than usual because that's her general effective game plan.

### <a name="head6"></a>6. Sharpen reactions

This is another thing I need to work on. Go the the lab and set the dummy to either jump in, walk in, press a button, or do a special move. Challenge yourself to counter or successfully nullify their movements consistently.

### <a name="head7"></a>7. Take notes/set goals

The way I take notes is with a journal. I'll make notes of my performance at the end of the day so I can visually keep track of my progress/mistakes. When all the details are in my head, it's hard for me to reflect upon. I have to get it out on paper. Or even in a blog, similar to the one I'm writing for people to read right now.
    
So taking notes and writing things down can help in setting goals. My goals in the beginning were things like consistenly land a punish combo. If I'm getting countered alot, stop pressing a button or doing the move and evaluate why I'm getting hit. Your goals will make you a stronger player when it's time to perform against other folks. I enter into tournaments all the time to evaluate what I've been working on. Reddit hosts an online tournment every Monday. I do this as a measure of what I've been working on. Everyone is different though. Competition is not everything. It is just my ninja way.
    
### <a name="head8"></a>8. Accept responsibility
 
This isn't in the video and I won't speak too much on this subject. I just believe it is worth mentioning. I try to accept responsibility and hold myself accountable for my own decisions and actions. I ask questions all day but relying on the phrase "I haven't learned that yet" or "No one told me about that" only took me so far. I play my game with the philosphy of, "Play as if you are a master, but learn like you are a student."

### <a name="head9"></a>9. Other things or stuff that deserve a whole post on their own
    
Get social. Join a discord. Find a google doc that is maintained by a community about a specific character (like the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aBEIXYX51TmdEZ_nh6dydHxJXwED7kZNsfLKENanca0/" target="_blank">R.Mika bible</a>).
