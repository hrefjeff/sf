It will be FT5 between me, Buttnaked, versus the infamous Nikos. The 2 R.Mikas of Huntsville Alabama. It'll be Cincuenta Cincuenta's at its finest. Not only is it for the money ($50), but also for the most important thing. THE RIGHTS TO TALK THAT TRASH! WHO'S GONNA GUESS RIGHT TONIGHT!?

This is a special occasion because I've been playing this game for roughly a little over year. I spent even less time at my local scene. But when I first arrived at my local (which is at Lucky Dice cafe every thursday), one of the first people I ran into was a dude named Nikos. Every thursday he would beat me silly. HOWEVER! It hasn't been until recently where I consistently beat him. He hasn't recognized that so I had to call him out.

Here are some of my notes on how I'll be approaching the match up and collecting my prize tonight:

### R.Mika Mirror Match

#### General things I'll keep in mind

<ol>
<li>CR.MK THE DROPKICK!!! Low profiling the dropkick is essential in this match up</li>
<li>Play patient when in neutral. Watch for the general 4 tendencies of getting in:</li><br>
<pre>
  1. Dash
  2. Jump (splash)
  3. Charged dropkick
  4. Stand mp -> ex peach
</pre>
<li>Take the landing frame throws. They'll most likely be brimstones, so backdash.</li>
<li>When he calls nadeshiko then I'll call nadeshiko. Otherwise, count to 3 and jump diagonally.</li>
<li>st.mk to counter wake up CA</li>
<li>Mix in regular throws from time to time</li>
</ol>

#### Defensive options

<ol>
  <li>Charged dropkick</li>
<pre>
  1. PRE  - low profile with cr.mk
  2. PRE  - walk+quick attack
  3. PRE  - backdash to force whiff
  4. PRE  - Jump in (divebomb)
  5. POST - Guess Right
</pre>
  <li>Dive bomb</li>
<pre>
  1. block
  2. dash under
  3. wingless airplane
</pre>
  <li>st.mk</li>
<pre>
  1. st.mk
  2. cr.mk
  3. ex.peach
</pre>
  <li>st.mp ---> *MAAAAAASH*</li>
  <li>f.hp  ---> st.lk after blocking this. It shifts the hitbox back and avoids st.mp frametrap and cmd grabs</li>
  <li>brimstone --> backdash</li>
  <li>ex-peach --> Back tech + walkback. If I notice a chasedown coming, I'll neutral tech + mash cr.lp</li>
</ol>
  
#### Offensive options

<ol>
  <li>cr.mk --> V-trigger activate. Everybody and they mama cr.hp and activate, but it can wiff and your S.O.L.</li>
  <li>Walking + blocking. Cuz we ain't no bitch. In the corner especially.</li>
  <li>Fake pressure when I have conditioned accordingly</li>
  <li>Tick-throws!!</li>
<pre>
  1. st.lk --> cmd
  2. st.lp --> st. lp --> ex.swing
  3. st.lk --> cr.lk --> ex.brimestone
  4. st.lk --> microwalk --> cr.lp --> microwalk --> reg.grab
</pre>
  <li>Oki situations</li>
<pre>
  1. brimstone (corner)    --> st.lp --> f.HP --(if delayed)--> st.lp (x2) --> f.HP or cr.mp
  2. brimstone (midscreen) --> dash --> (+2) cr.lp --(if delayed)--> st.lp (x2) --> f.HP or cr.mp
  3. peach                 --> dash --> (+2) st.lp --> st.lp --> st.mp
  4. ex.peach              --> dash --> (+1) cr.lp --(if delayed)--> f.HP
</pre>
  <li>If there is wake up V-trigger, and I'm pressing a button, cancel into WA or EX.peach</li>
</ol>

#### The nootch (I'll probably take the Joey900 approach)

<ol>
  <li>NOT get baited into the corner. The ol' walk back and then do a back throw or something is strong.</li>
  <li>Walk + block. Until he starts poking to counter that. Then I counter poke. Then he'll start approaching. Then I'll poke. On and on and on</li>
  <li>Whiff safe moves like st.lk, st.lp, and sprinkle in random uncharged drop kicks.</li>
</ol>  

Oh. Btw. Just got Karin to Platinum (7500LP).
