Soooo. It's been a while. And I'm looking back at these past couple of notes and it's still enough to leave me in tears from laughter. Mainly because I'm still a noob.

Points-wise, I'm at 20k with my main account, where I primarily use R.Mika. I recently began another account and main Karin Kanzuki on that one. It has taken me 2 weeks to get to 5.5k perntz. I'm starting to get my shimmy on now too ( <a href="https://media.eventhubs.com/images/2016/05/28_valleface04t.jpg" target="_blank">evil laugh</a> ).

I'm reflecting upon what has happened since the last entry of this little blog. Thinking about all the tournaments I've participated in, people I've gotten to meet and train with, lessons I've learned, and the overall time I have put into this game. I can honestly say I have no ragrets. SFV has been a wild ride.

Goals for now:
  1. Earn Diamond rank (14,000LP) with Ms. Kanzuki and run the set with Yi.
  2. Write at least 1 helpful guide targeted toward a concept in SFV that I didn't understand the first go around. (Potentially meaty attacks?)
  3. Get my plane ticket for EVO2019!
