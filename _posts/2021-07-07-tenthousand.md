I have officially use Zeku 10,000 times (the lady on CFN (capcom fighters network) told me that). Shortly after, I reached the rank of Grand Master. Malcom Gladwell wrote a book called "Outliers" that introduced the "10,000 hour rule" where it explains that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become proficient at something. This concept can be applied to SFV to become better. Although I noticed that I reached a plateau before and the game-changer for me was when I started applying **_deliberate_** practice.
