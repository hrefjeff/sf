My self-talk is crazy.
I decided to develop my inner voice to be more kind and one that I want to guide me.
Also, I know when no one else is on my side, I am.
I'm in my own corner and that's the person that I realized I needed to start with.
As Kendrick said, "...what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?"

Here is a sample of affirmations I go through. I am...

- A Champion
- The greatest
- Kind
- In a constant state of elevation
- Getting mine
- Equipped
- Standing my ground 
- Consistent 
- A listener 
- Balanced 
- Growth mindset 
- Letting go
- In control of my thoughts during hard times
- SHOWING UP
- Hungry hungry HUNGRY
- Clay
- Passionate 
- A warrior
- Practicing
