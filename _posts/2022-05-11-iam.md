My self-talk is crazy.
I decided to develop my inner voice to be more kind and one that I want to guide me.
Also, I know when no one else is on my side, I am.
I'm in my own corner and that's the person that I realized I needed to start with.
As Kendrick said, "...what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?"

Here is a sample of affirmations I go through. I am...

- Having Fun

- Growth mindset 
- Letting Go
- In Control Of My Mentality
- SHOWING UP
- Hungry Hungry HUNGRY
- Clay
- Passionate 
- A Warrior
- Practicing
- Limitless
