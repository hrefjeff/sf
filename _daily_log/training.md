# Anti-Air Training

So something clicked yesterday. To improve DP’s from blocking position, I need to first of all not block soooo much. Be at a range where I’m safe and move forward so I’ll already be prepared to AA DP. But also, moving forward is a move. Instead of moving forward + pressing a button, it’s moving forward with intent.

Rashid action recording settings that should be translated to other characters:

1. Forward moving special
1. Small steps and light low attack
1. CC move
1. Walk back half a second
1. Jump + heavy attack

OZ anti-air pomodoros. I am moving constantly but I'm going to try to cut out noise/jitter in my movement. Moving with intent

Struggle = practice
Flow = performance
Flow is when difficulty meets skill at the right level
