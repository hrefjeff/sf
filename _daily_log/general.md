# Currently Working On
1. Stale block strings - I do the same block strings. Even if I know they aren't mashing through them, I still don't do fake stuff and lose my turn with light block strings that do no chip damage. I would like to test out doing cLP into cHP with OZ and more stance switches into buttons

1. Jumping entirely too much, not focusing on neutral

1. Defending vtrigger activations without backdashing/jumping back

1. My DP with OZ feels lethargic. Pomodoro DP drills

TIL: YZ If you jump in with heavy kick then you can do stHK to catch grabs. If you jump in with heavy kick you’re at too much frame advantage and immediate throw will whiff.

D-Guy-of-War jumps in with heavy kick and does exDash to bait the throw. Can follow up with slide

Stale:

While in corner, crJab cross up
Same block string, cMP --> cLP --> cMP

# 2020-07-25
Need to improve OZ anti-airs after light blockstring
Trying out OZ stMP to HP transform

stMP (counter hit) → crHP target combo → run slide

Fullscreen bomb need to walk towards him

Sets with kidd. As ryu, vreversal offensively to get grey life.

well in that +5 situation you were more willing to risk an exDP
and with YZ you played faster
so you dashed and jumped at odd times

Switching forms twice can throw opponent off

Started doing crlp into heavy palm when this sakura was mashing 3f. Gave me advantage position on screen

Need to start doing fake crLP into HP.Palm

Watching NASR AngryBird (Zeku) VS CAG Dogura (M. Bison) - VSFighting Loser's Top 12 - CPT 2019 and infexious(Zeku) vs -Isam-(M.Bison) SFV you can see young zeku stays right outside of psycho axe range

EX Devils reverse to get out of the corner can be countered by jump back HK CYG BST Infexious (Zeku) vs CAG Dogura (M. Bison/Urien) - CELTIC THROWDOWN 2019 Pools - CPT 2019

Vs. M.Bison - Crescent_God_Cmg
stHP is a very good buffer button. Use Zeku crHK to best combat this move
Try start using the following block strings more
OZ stHP → transform → crLP → {option stLK or dash}
OZ crLP → crLP → stLP → light koku
Vs. Guile - AMKidd
Did 3 FT5’s. Lost first. Won second. Lost third.
Good pace. Baited out EX reversals in the second set

Infexious replay https://youtu.be/eePEJx2g2Sg
