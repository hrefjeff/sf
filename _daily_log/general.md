# Currently Working On

1. Anti-airs
    1. Old Zeku
        1. HK DP with OZ feels lethargic. Pomodoro DP drills
        1. crHP more! That's a legit anti-air in zone 2 almost at 3
        1. air-to-air
    1. Young Zeku
        1. stMK
        1. light shoulder
        1. air-to-air
            1. mp (causes juggle)
            1. heavy punch
            1. lp (jump back jab)
            1. lk
        1. CA

2. Stale block strings - I do the same block strings. Even if I know they aren't mashing through them, I still don't do fake stuff and lose my turn with light block strings that do no chip damage. I would like to test out doing cLP into cHP with OZ and more stance switches into buttons. Here are the true block strings I use the most:
```
    1. Young
        a. sMP -> sMP
        b. cMP -> cLP -> cMP
        c. cLP -> sMP -> sLK
        d. cLK -> cLP -> cLK
    1. Old
        a. cLP -> cLP -> sLP -> koku
        b. sMP -> sMP -> sLK
        c. (4-framer) cLP -> sMP
        d. sMK -> sLK
```
3. Jumping entirely too much, not focusing on neutral

4. Defending vtrigger activations without backdashing/jumping back

# 2020-09-22

Entered into the reddit tourney and just missed top 8. Lost to LizardMan (rashid) and og_killakam (akuma).

Rashid was using light spinning mixer in neutral and I could not deal well with it. It felt like Balrog's dash punch or Honda's headbutt. I got caught once backdashing the situation with eagle spike. It was more of a read than a reaction to the backdash. In training mode right after I did a small amount of practice. He did it at zone 2 mostly so I set the dummy up to do it at the same range. OB it is -2.

1. Both
    1. Neutral jump (but be careful, if he has meter he can react with ex eagle spike)
1. OZ
    1. cHP blown up because too slow
    1. cMP is time specific. It'll trade in his favor more often than not
    1. DP actually worked alot of the time
1. YZ
    1. Just block. He put himself in a -2 situation and made it easier for me to execute Young Zeku's general gameplan
    1. light palm trades in my favor because he gets knocked back

killakam's momementum based. He'll hang back and whiff sMK most times. If akuma has full Vtrigger and CA get to a space right out of sweep range. He can't whiff red fireball
activate anymore so find out if he's thirsty for activation or not and find an opening during the thirst.

TIL: YZ If you jump in with heavy kick then you can do stHK to catch grabs. If you jump in with heavy kick you’re at too much frame advantage and immediate throw will whiff.

D-Guy-of-War jumps in with heavy kick and does exDash to bait the throw. Can follow up with slide

# 2020-07-25

Stale:

While in corner, crJab cross up
Same block string, cMP --> cLP --> cMP

# 2020-07-25
Need to improve OZ anti-airs after light blockstring
Trying out OZ stMP to HP transform

stMP (counter hit) → crHP target combo → run slide

Fullscreen bomb need to walk towards him

# 2020-07-05

Sets with kidd. As ryu, vreversal offensively to get grey life.

well in that +5 situation you were more willing to risk an exDP
and with YZ you played faster
so you dashed and jumped at odd times

Switching forms twice can throw opponent off

Started doing crlp into heavy palm when this sakura was mashing 3f. Gave me advantage position on screen

# 2020-06-18

Need to start doing fake crLP into HP.Palm

Watching NASR AngryBird (Zeku) VS CAG Dogura (M. Bison) - VSFighting Loser's Top 12 - CPT 2019 and infexious(Zeku) vs -Isam-(M.Bison) SFV you can see young zeku stays right outside of psycho axe range

EX Devils reverse to get out of the corner can be countered by jump back HK CYG BST Infexious (Zeku) vs CAG Dogura (M. Bison/Urien) - CELTIC THROWDOWN 2019 Pools - CPT 2019

Vs. Rashid - NB_Squall
YZ Optimization VT2 & 1 Bar: stMP→crMP→exHazanto→transform→hkDP →VT2
OZ Optimization 2 Bar: exTeki → transform → ex instant airgrab

# 2020-06-16

Vs. M.Bison - Crescent_God_Cmg
stHP is a very good buffer button. Use Zeku crHK to best combat this move
Try start using the following block strings more
OZ stHP → transform → crLP → {option stLK or dash}
OZ crLP → crLP → stLP → light koku
Vs. Guile - AMKidd
Did 3 FT5’s. Lost first. Won second. Lost third.
Good pace. Baited out EX reversals in the second set

Infexious replay https://youtu.be/eePEJx2g2Sg 
Try stMP→crLP→stMK→crMP→crHP @ 1:30

## Vs. Ryu - AMKidd

When low health: How can my opponent win?
Need to improve anti-airs
In the beginning - I was more defensive
Avoid tunnel vision (Trying to get the kill with a pixel left)
