Efficient Training (Pomodoro Technique)


Who? I’m boomi. Fighting game enthusiast.
What? Pomodoro technique to maximize training in a given time period
When? Anytime you set up a regimen. After a FT5 and you notice a pattern of inconsistencies. After your review your replays. After a tournament.
Where? Training mode in sfv
Why? To get better and target specific ideas
Nothing more important than devotion to practice! Efficient practice!
I believe greatness happens when preparation meets opportunity. Opportunity is fleeting though. So how can you make sure to take advantage of that opportunity? With preparation! I've been applying a technique to my training that has been doing wonders for my gameplay. It's called the Pomodoro technique.
I look to Infexious (which is arguably the best tournament Zeku in the world right now that plays on pad) for advice on how to train. He says to repeat an action roughly 2000-3000 times to get it into your muscle memory. It's actually not that much work to do considering the benefits. To accomplish this efficiently I use the Pomodoro technique to accomplish this.
The Pomodoro technique is essentially an interval timer. I'll set a timer for 1 minute to see how many of a certain move I can do. Then I'll set a timer for 10 minutes and continuously practice 1 thing. After the 10 minutes are up I'll take a 3-minute break. Rinse and repeat.


How?


Online pomodoro timers. I try to find something light to use. It’s like the sprinkle on top. It shouldn’t take up too much time to set up.
